what I have to add

1. Tests on Normality and fat-tailedness to indicate the direction of Non-Normality. Basically it is done. DONE

2. Add core CPI and PPI inflation and may be wage inflation?

3. Bivariate estimation of the Phillips curve.

4. Structural decomposition of the Bivariate Phillips curve with exclusion restrictions



#########Description###########

the univariate analysis of causal/noncausal structures of inflation in different countries

The file brownbag1.r contain script on univariate TSA of causal and noncausal structures of the U.S. Phillips Curve
functions.r are the neccessary functions written for the brownbag1.r

some tests.r - handwritten versions of the Breusch-Godfrey, RESET, and test on ARCH effects

experimental - some playground on noncausal estimation. i.e. automatic functions. is not finished

############Problems##############

- Residual autocorrelation present in the data, for order 12 for CPI in GM
- ppi in GM period is not causal, which mildly contradicts my conclusion
- MSE statistic contradicts LL criterion
